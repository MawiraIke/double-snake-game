[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/MawiraIke/double-snake-game/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/MawiraIke/double-snake-game)

The snake game, but with two snakes instead.

Enjoy yourself. Set your hair on fire.

Ps: Just for fun, this game was just made to test if this idea is possible to play, and by 
how far.

### Steps to play (with clojure CLI)

run `clj -Sdeps '{:deps {double-snake-game {:git/url "https://github.com/MawiraIke/double-snake-game.git" :sha "42a47c8bdbeb37ca2e6c6bf2e8051bf6f5c656b7"}}}' -m double-snake-game.core`

### Steps to play
If you have git installed, 
1. Clone this repo. If git is not installed, get it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and 
then repeat step one.
2. Assuming you have Leiningen installed run 
```lein run -m double-snake-game.core``` 
from the root of this project else run the jar file in the ```.\target``` folder

Use the arrow and WASD keys to control the snakes.
