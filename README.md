###"Snakes"

The snake game, but with two snakes instead.

I mean who plays the snake game in 2020? People are too smart for that. Try this snake game with two snakes instead.
Just make sure the snakes don't bite themselves or the other or any walls.

Enjoy yourself. Set your hair on fire.

Ps: This game is not made for commercial purposes, it was just made to test if this idea is possible to play, and by how far.
