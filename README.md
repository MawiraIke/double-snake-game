### "Snakes"

The snake game, but with two snakes instead.

Enjoy yourself. Set your hair on fire.

Ps: Just for fun, this game was just made to test if this idea is possible to play, and by 
how far.

### Steps to play
If you have git installed, 
1. Clone this repo. If git is not installed, get it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and 
then repeat step one.
2. Assuming you have java installed run 
```java -jar target/double-snake-game-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar``` 
from the root of this project.

Use the arrow and WASD keys to control the snakes.
